siege-cli is a CLI tool for interacting with the [Siege](https://siege.hackclub.com) website.
Currently, listing your projects and updating their information is supported.
Update notes are in a [separate file](UPDATE.md)

## Cookies

siege-cli requires your `_siege_session` and sometimes `cf_clearance` cookies to work.
You might be asked to retrieve them from time to time, if a request gets denied because of them expiring.

In case you are being asked for a cf_clearance and it is not present in the cookie list, it is most likely okay to just create/overwrite the `session.json` file with `{"cf_clearance":""}` to suppress the warning.
This can also be done by pressing Enter to the cf_clearance prompt without pasting anything.
